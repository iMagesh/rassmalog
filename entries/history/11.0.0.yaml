  This release removes needless cruft (keep it simple!), adds new plugins, adds
  support for Ruby 1.9.0, freshens the default CSS theme, fixes translation
  files, and updates the documentation.


  h1. Thanks

  * Aggelos Orfanakos contributed fixes for the Greek language translation file.

  * Josef 'Jupp' Schugt suggested the "Lazy
    Blogging":http://cip.physik.uni-bonn.de/~jupp/2008-03-16-lazy-blogging.html
    feature.

  * Greg Weber suggested creating an official *preview* task and contributed a
    HTML validation plugin (<tt>plugins/validate.rb</tt>).


  h1. Caution

  * Trailing dashes are now correctly removed from generated file names (the
    result of @String#to_file_name@). As a result, you may need to update
    hyperlinks to blog entries generated with a previous version of Rassmalog.

  * The entire <tt>config/entry.erb</tt> template is no longer rendered inside
    the RSS feed. Instead, only the text of the entry (and a "read more" link,
    if necessary) are rendered.

  * The search page no longer has a JavaScript-based search implementation.
    Instead, visitors are urged to use their browser's built-in search
    mechanism, which is _far_ superior to what is possible with JavaScript.


  h1. Improvements

  * Added the <tt>plugins/new.rb</tt> plugin which provides a Rake task for
    easily creating new blog entry source files. See "the
    documentation":../doc/guide.html#plugins-new.rb for more information.

  * Added an official *preview* task which continuously generates the blog while
    you write your blog entries.

  * Added documentation about plugin usage, creating mulitple RSS feeds, and the
    *preview* task to the user guide.


  h2. Usability

  * Added an "all entries" link (in between the older/newer navigation links for
    a blog entry) which takes you to the corresponding place in the list of all
    entries. This allows users to access nearby entries without fear of having
    to scroll through the gigantic "all entries" list, just to return to where
    they were a few pages ago!

  * Enhanced the default CSS style by providing more visual clues about the
    navigation menu, document structure, and page layout.


  h1. Repairs

  * Fixed several Ruby warnings

  * Added support for Ruby 1.9.0
