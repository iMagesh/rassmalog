  This release updates the documentation and improves error reporting.

  h1. Caution

  * In the <tt>config/format.rb</tt> file, the @String.coderay@ and @String.redcloth@ have been renamed to @String.thru_coderay@ and @String.thru_redcloth@ for consistency with the @String.thru_erb@ method.

  h1. Repairs

  * The stack trace of an error now shows the blog entry file and/or the ERB template file(s) involved, instead of always showing the ambiguous '(erb)' identifier.  As a result, you can better trace the source of a problem.

  * The CSS styles corressponding to the search form and search results/error box have been moved into <tt>input/styles/screen.css</tt> as requested by Josef 'Jupp' Schugt.

  * Added documentation for more attributes in the API reference documentation.
