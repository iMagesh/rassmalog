  This release improves usability, adds support for multiple feeds, and adds an
  "official user guide":../doc/guide.html.

  Furthermore, the project mailing list, forums, and bug / patches / request
  trackers have been replaced with a new support & feeback system: just send the
  author (me) an e-mail! Simpler, isn't it?


  h1. Caution

  * The @GENERATOR@ object has been renamed to @Rassmalog@.

  * The @RECENT_ENTRIES@ array has been renamed to @NEW_ENTRIES@.

  * The *num_recent_entries* blog configuration parameter has been renamed to
    @new_entries@.


  h1. Improvements

  * The "front page" file is now copied as "index.html" (when possible). This
    eliminates the need to use the ugly HTML META redirect in the front page.

  * Added the ability to specify multiple RSS feeds for the blog. The user
    simply adds "feed" commands to their <tt>Rakefile</tt> to set up a new feed
    (see the file for an example).
  ** The @FEEDS@ array keeps track of registered blog feeds.

  * Added the *gen* Rake task, which is an alias to the *default* Rake task.


  h1. Repairs

  * The name of an entry and the title of a page were not sent through the
    text-to-HTML conversion mechanism.

  * Fix translation of  "all entries" in Telugu translation file.

  * Added a border to the table in <tt>config/chapter.erb</tt>.


  h1. Usability

  * Moved the navigation menu to the bottom of the page. This helps text-mode
    browsers see the main content of the page without needing to scroll too
    much. Of course, this change is invisible to users of graphical web browsers
    -- everything appears as it did previously to them.

  * Remove stupid @pre:hover@ CSS trick, it hinders usability because it hides
    the fact that the viewport has been truncated until the user hovers their
    cursor over the element.

  * Adjust usage of invisible @<br>@ and @<hr>@ elements for text-mode browsers.

  * Move next/prev links *beneath* tag/archive name -- it's unnoticable when
    @float: right@ because it's too close to the navigation menu.

  * Moved the search box into the navigation menu. It was distracting from the
    blog name & info up at the top.

  * The <tt>config/format.rb</tt> file now inserts a "border=1" attribute on all
    HTML tables. This _greatly_ improves readability in text-mode web browsers!
