  h1. Textile example

  The following text is "a
  sample":http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/?sample=2 from the "Textile
  website":http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/. It will show you how to
  format your text with Textile.

  ---


  h2{color:green}. This is a title

  h3. This is a subhead

  p{color:red}. This is some text of dubious character. Isn't the use of
  "quotes" just lazy writing -- and theft of 'intellectual property'
  besides? I think the time has come to see a block quote.

  bq[fr]. This is a block quote. I'll admit it's not the most exciting block
  quote ever devised.

  Simple list:

  #{color:blue} one
  # two
  # three

  Multi-level list:

  # one
  ## aye
  ## bee
  ## see
  # two
  ## x
  ## y
  # three

  Mixed list:

  * Point one
  * Point two
  ## Step 1
  ## Step 2
  ## Step 3
  * Point three
  ** Sub point 1
  ** Sub point 2


  Well, that went well. How about we insert an <a href="/" title="watch
  out">old-fashioned hypertext link</a>? Will the quote marks in the tags
  get messed up? No!

  "This is a link (optional title)":http://www.textism.com

  table{border:1px solid black}.
  |_. this|_. is|_. a|_. header|
  <{background:gray}. |\2. this is|{background:red;width:200px}. a|^<>{height:200px}. row|
  |this|<>{padding:10px}. is|^. another|(bob#bob). row|

  An image:

  !http://www.textism.com/common/textist.gif(optional alt text)!

  # Librarians rule
  # Yes they do
  # But you knew that

  Some more text of dubious character. Here is a noisome string of CAPITAL
  letters. Here is something we want to _emphasize_. That was a linebreak.
  And something to indicate *strength*. Of course I could use <em>my own
  HTML tags</em> if I <strong>felt</strong> like it.

  h3. Coding

  This <code>is some code, "isn't it"</code>. Watch those quote marks! Now
  for some preformatted text:

  <pre>
  <code>
    $text = str_replace("<p>%::%</p>","",$text);
    $text = str_replace("%::%</p>","",$text);
    $text = str_replace("%::%","",$text);

  </code>
  </pre>

  This isn't code.


  So you see, my friends:

  * The time is now
  * The time is not later
  * The time is not yesterday
  * We must act
