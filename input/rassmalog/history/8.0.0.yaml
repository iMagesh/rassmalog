  This release improves appearance and navigability, and updates the documentation.


  h1. Thanks

  * Michael Kwan and Alaric Holloway reviewed the new "look" of Rassmalog and provided insightful usability feedback.


  h1. Caution

  * In the <tt>config/blog.yaml</tt> file, the *menu* parameter has been renamed to *links*. The other templates and CSS files have been corrected accordingly.

  * The <tt>entry/list.erb</tt> has been renamed to <tt>entry/listing.erb</tt>.

  * The "permalinks" at the end of every heading have been removed because they were unsightful and useless: since Rassmalog does not follow the typical blog software convention of jamming old blog entries into a single "archive" page, there is no reason for a "permalink" in Rassmalog.

  * There are new terms in the translation files.  Some unused terms have been removed.


  h1. Improvements

  * Added older/newer links to a blog entry, next/previous links to a section, and highlighting of the item in the navigation menu that corresponds to the current web page (also known as "bread crumbs").  This makes the blog feel more _connected_.

  * Added a <code>@solo</code> variable to the <tt>config/entry.erb</tt> template which allows you to customize how the entry appears when it is rendered on its own page vs. when it is embedded inside something.

  * A blog entry's summary & tags are now put into the 'description' and 'keywords' HTML META fields instead of the blog description.


  h1. Repairs

  * Added error reporting when loading the <tt>config/blog.yaml</tt> file.

  * Made the HTML META redirect in <tt>output/index.html</tt> more standards compliant.

  * A double horizontal-rule (hr) is no longer shown at the bottom of the web page in text-only browsers.

  * The sorted-by-name table in the main archives index is now sorted by date instead.
