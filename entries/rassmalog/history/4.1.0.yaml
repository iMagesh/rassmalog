  This release fixes the license and RSS feed validity, and improves usability and entry summarization.


  h1. Repairs

  * The license was non-free because it disallowed selling.

  * Headings are now omitted from entry summaries. For example, if your entry's text starts out with a heading like <pre>h1. Introduction</pre> then that heading will not be put into the summary. See the <tt>config/entry.erb</tt> template for details.

  * Invalid URI characters in URLs (for sending e-mail comments) were not properly escaped in the RSS feed.


  h1. Usability

  * Added a "trail of bread crumbs", with links to an entry's tags and archive, just below an entry's name. This makes it easier to browse entries and find related entries.  See the <tt>config/entry.erb</tt> template for details.

  * The "Entries" link now appears just after the "Home" link in the main navigation area because it seems more natural to want to see a listing of all entries after you've just seen the most recent ones.


  h1. Features

  * The blog author's name (at the bottom of the <tt>config/html.erb</tt> template) is now hyperlinked to the comments e-mail address if the e-mail comments are enabled.

  * The @String.table_of_contents@ method now accepts a block, which allows for custom processing of the hierarchical structure of an XHTML document.
