Rassmalog is a simple, static blog engine based on RSS 2.0, YAML, and Ruby.
It features an extensible formatting system, automatic tagging and
archiving, and easy configuration.

The name "rassmalog" is derived from the word "rassmalai", which is a
delicious Indian dessert, and the words "rss", "yml", and "blog".
