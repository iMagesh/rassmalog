  This release cleans up the configuration, restores support for users with 640x480 screen resolution, repairs some defects, and improves performance, the default CSS theme, and the documentation.


  h1. Caution

  * In <tt>config/blog.yaml</tt>, the following parameters have been renamed:
  ** recent_entries &rarr; num_recent_entries
  ** table_of_contents &rarr; generate_toc

  * In <tt>config/format.rb</tt>:
  ** The *&lt;format:verbatim&gt;* tag has been renamed to *&lt;noformat&gt;* for consistency with the &lt;noscript&gt; HTML tag.

  * All forms of punctuation are now replaced with a single dash (-) in output file names. As a result, you might have to update your existing usage of URLs to other blog entry output files.

  * The *rake clean* command now removes all output files that were generated by Rassmalog -- instead of removing all files that were copied from <tt>input/</tt> into <tt>output/</tt>.


  h1. Repairs

  * The search page is now updated whenever a blog entry is updated.

  * The search form was being submitted (causing the entire search page to reload) when JavaScript was disabled in Firefox.

  * The default CSS theme is now friendly for users of 640x480 screen resolutions. In fact, the theme is now fully elastic, and thereby supports any screen resolution!

  * URLs for fragment links are no longer shown in the printer-friendly CSS style.


  h1. Updates

  * You can now use eRuby directives and HTML formatting directives in the values of more parameters in <tt>config/blog.yaml</tt>. The documentation for these parameters has been updated with usage emblems.

  * The performance of the @Chapter#[]@ method has been improved.
