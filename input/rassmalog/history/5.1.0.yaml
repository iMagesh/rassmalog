  This release fixes several defects and increases the scriptability of blog entries.

  h1. Thanks

  Josef 'Jupp' Schugt reported defects, contributed patches, and suggested features.


  h1. Caution

  * The RSS feed now contains _only_ the most recent entries of your blog. {Jupp}


  h1. Features

  * An @@entry@ variable is now available for use within a blog entry's *text* parameter. This variable gives information about the blog entry, such as its input and output file names, its tags, date, and so on.


  h1. Repairs

  * @strftime("%Z")@ does not always produce numerical output. As a result, the RSS feed was not always passing the "feed validator":http://feedvalidator.org. {Jupp}

  * @String.to_html@ now removes &lt;span&gt; tags around acronyms, which are added by RedCloth. These tags cause unwanted HTML code to appear when acronyms are used in the title of a web page or RSS feed items. {Jupp}

  * Entries were always summarized on the 'recent entries' page, regardless of  the *summarize_entries* configuration parameter. {Jupp}

  * Anchor links in a blog entry's summary now correctly take you inside the entry's web page.

  * HTML tags are now removed from the HTML anchors of headings in the table of contents.


  h1. Usability

  * Added CSS style for the "Read more..." link. {Jupp}
