  This release simplifies feed creation and fixes some visual artifacts.


  h1. Thanks

  Josef 'Jupp' Schugt suggested making multi-word tags non-breaking.


  h1. Features

  The @feed@ method now allows you to create feeds containing only a single blog entry:

  <code>
  # create a feed for the most newest entry only!
  feed 'first.xml', ENTRIES.first, 'single entry'
  </code>


  h1. Repairs

  * Multi-word tags are now non-breaking, so if you zoom the text on the tags page, multi-word tags will stay together as a single unit. {Jupp}

  * The links menu was pushing the main content below it if the browser window was too small or the font size was too big.
