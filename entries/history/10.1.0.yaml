  This release adds support for plugins, adds more translations, and fixes
  some bugs in RSS feed and blog generation.


  h1. Thanks

  "Laurent Vallar":http://zbla.net and "Greg Weber":http://thoughtfolder.com
  contributed patches and suggestions! :-)


  h1. Caution

  * The *import* task has been renamed to *import_rss*.

  * The *gen* task is no longer invoked when the <tt>Rakefile</tt> file changes.

  * There is now a separate *search* task for generating the search page.


  h1. Improvements

  * Added a <tt>plugins/</tt> directory for non-essential Rake tasks. You can
    add your own files (which provide Rake tasks) into this directory and load
    them into your <tt>Rakefile</tt>.

    Currently, there is a plugin that provides a Rake task for importing blog
    entries from an RSS feed.

  * Laurent Vallar translated more strings from the templates for the French
    language. I have updated the Telugu and other translation files accordingly.

  * Comments are now omitted when an entry is summarized, because you would like
    the reader to fully read your blog entry before they make comments about it.
    {Greg Weber}

  * The @Chapter#[]@ method now raises an error when you try to access an
    unknown section by name. It also lets you access sections by index or
    range -- the traditional array access idioms. {Greg Weber}


  h1. Repairs

  * The search page was being generated whenever *entry* task was invoked. This
    defeated the ability to rapidly preview entries while editing them.

  * Entry content was omitted from RSS feed when summary was not available.

  * The "read more" link was omitted for summarized entries in the RSS feed.

  * Greg Weber suggested that the first HTML block-level element should be
    accepted as the summary of a blog entry (in addition to the current scheme
    of accepting the first "paragraph" of text) because the current scheme makes
    strong assumptions about RedCloth's implementation.

  * The URL for author's e-mail (at the bottom of <tt>config/html.erb</tt>) was
    being escaped twice. {Greg Weber}

  * Laurent Vallar and Greg Weber fixed the renaming of @Rassmalog[:url]@ to
    @Rassmalog[:website]@. In addition, Greg Weber added protection to raise an
    error if such mistakes are made in the future.

  * The <tt>index.html</tt> file was not updated when the "front page" file
    changes.

  * Redundant nested &lt;pre&gt; elements were not being collapsed by
    <tt>config/format.rb</tt>.
