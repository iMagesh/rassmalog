  This release improves appearance, simplifies the main HTML template, and fixes several bugs.


  h1. Caution

  * Revised the project license text for clarity.

  * Removed the "menu" element and dissolved its functionality into the "links" element in <tt>config/html.erb</tt>.  Updated the CSS files accordingly.

  * New phrases have been added to the translation files.


  h1. Repairs

  * The "copy" task was not copying empty directories.

  * ARCHIVES was not ordered by date.

  * Prevented the generation of next/prev link in <tt>config/section.erb</tt> when it "wraps around" the array.

  * Fixed conversion of @--@ into &mdash; before redcloth spoils it, in <tt>config/format.rb</tt>.

  * Fixed a Ruby syntax warning in <tt>config/format.rb</tt>.

  * Renamed the ambiguous "Entries" phrase to "All entries" for better coordination with the "Recent entries" phrase.

  * Moved the main blog navigation menu into the user-defined menu of links in <tt>config/html.erb</tt>.  It was getting in the way of the main attraction of the web page: the blog entry itself!
