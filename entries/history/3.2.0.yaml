  This release improves usability and simplifies the blog's appearance.


  h1. Features

  * Tags and archives now use the "tag cloud":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud visualization method.
  ** You can configure the cloud generation in the <tt>config/chapter.erb</tt> template.

  * A <tt>config/index.erb</tt> template has been added for customization of generated <tt>index*.html</tt> files.
  ** The search page now explicitly states that it is really just an exhaustive listing of the content of all entries available on the blog.



  h1. Usability

  * Jakob Nielsen's "guidelines for web design":http://www.useit.com/alertbox/ are now followed.

  * Added horizontal rules (@<hr/>@) to improve readability in text-mode browsers.


  h1. Mechanics

  * Entry summarization is now the responsibility of the <tt>config/entry.erb</tt> template.
  ** When entries are summarized, their meta information (date, tags, etc.) is now omitted because I feel that people are more interested in the content of a blog entry than when it was written and how it is tagged. This omission leads to a much cleaner and simpler user interface.

    As always, you can change this behavior if you wish.

  * The @String.table_of_contents@ method now operates on XHTML instead of Textile.
  ** The generated table of contents can link directly to _any_ HTML heading because it now supports nonstandard characters, such as HTML entities (and thereby non-English languages), nested HTML elements, and so on.
