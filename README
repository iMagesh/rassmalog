= Introduction

Rassmalog is a simple, static blog engine based on RSS 2.0, YAML, and Ruby.
It features an extensible blog formatting mechanism, automatic tagging and
archiving, and easy configuration.

Although it uses the Textile formatting system, it can be easily changed to
use any formatting system. It is inspired by the
Rog[http://rog.rubyforge.org] and hobix[http://hobix.com] blog engines.

== Etymology

The name _Rassmalog_ is derived from
{Rasmalai}[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmalai] (a delicious Indian
dessert) and is somewhat of a portmanteau of the words "rss", "yml", and
"blog".


== Organization

doc/:: API documentation from available files

config/:: directory that contains all configuration files

config/blog.yml:: the primary configuration file for your blog

config/html.erb:: template used to generate all HTML files

config/rss.erb:: template used to generate the RSS 2.0 feed

config/entry.erb:: template that transforms an entry into Textile

config/format.rb:: defines how text is transformed into HTML

entries/:: directory that contains all blog entries

entries/example.yml:: an example blog entry file

input/::  directory that contains resources (such as images, stylesheets,
          and so on) used by your blog

output/:: directory that contains all generated files. All files from the
          input/ directory are copied into this directory when you generate
          your blog.


= Requirements

The following software is required:

* RedCloth[http://whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/redcloth/]

* CodeRay[http://coderay.rubychan.de/]

If you have RubyGems[http://rubygems.org/] on your system, then you can
install the above requirements by running the following command:

  gem install redcloth coderay


== Bypassing the requirements / using another text formatting system

If you do not wish to install RedCloth and CodeRay, or if you wish to use a
different text formatting system, then you must edit the "config/format.rb"
file so that it does not make use of the above software.

For example, if you replace the contents of the "config/format.rb" file with
the following code, then the content of all entries will appear within
gray-colored <pre> elements.

  class String
    def to_html
      '<pre style="background-color: gray">' + self + '</pre>'
    end
  end
