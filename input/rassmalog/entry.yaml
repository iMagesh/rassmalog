#
# This is a blog entry which demonstrates the file
# format for all blog entries.  Blog entries are
# _plain text_ files marked up in YAML syntax.
# They are composed of key-value pairs, known as
# _parameters_, whose values are defined by you.
#
# The default set of parameters are shown below.  Of these, only the 'name' and
# 'text' parameters are required; the other parameters are completely optional.
#
# For your convenience, the description of each parameter
# below is marked with one or more of the following emblems:
#
# * (Required) This parameter is required.  If it is not present,
#              then Rassmalog will ignore this blog entry file.
#
# * (Optional) This parameter is completely optional.
#
# * (eRuby) You can use eRuby directives in the value of this parameter.
#
# * (HTML) The value of this parameter will be transformed into HTML using the
#          standard mechanism defined in the <tt>config/format.rb</tt> file.
#
# * (Example) This parameter is bogus; it exists
#             purely for illustrative purposes.
#
# In addition to the default set of parameters, you can define and use your own
# custom parameters in this blog entry.  An example of this is shown below.
#

  h1. Adding your own parameters

  You can add arbitrary parameters to a blog entry source file (which is really
  a YAML file) and use them in the blog entry's content (the *text* parameter).

  For example, in the source of this blog entry, you will find two custom
  parameters whose names begin with "your_own_parameter". To insert the values
  of these parameters into the blog entry's content, we use the following eRuby
  directive:

    <pre><%%= @entry[ 'name_of_the_parameter' ] %></pre>

  Here, we access a parameter's value by passing the parameter's name into the
  [] operator of the @@entry@ object.

  |_. Expression|_. Result|
  |@<%%= @entry['your_own_parameter1'] %>@|<%= @entry['your_own_parameter1'] %>|
  |@<%%= @entry['your_own_parameter2'] %>@|<%= @entry['your_own_parameter2'] %>|


  h1(#source). Source of this blog entry

  <pre><%=h File.read(@entry.input_file) %></pre>
