  This release gives you more control over where blog entries go in the <tt>output/</tt> directory and adds support for truly static web pages so you can build a complete website around your blog.

  It also adds a simple JavaScript search engine, makes it possible to use "dynamic blog comments":rassmalog/tricks/dynamic-comments.html, fixes a show-stopper bug on Microsoft Windows, refreshes the default CSS theme, and includes numerous other improvements.


  h1. Caution

  * The predefined variables in templates have changed because the underlying data structures used in Rassmalog have been dramatically simplified. Refer to the API documentation and the template source files for details.

  * The <tt>config/index.erb</tt> template has been renamed to <tt>config/list.erb</tt>.

  * The <tt>config/page.erb</tt> template has been renamed to <tt>config/section.erb</tt>. Likewise, the @Page@ class has been renamed to @Section@.

  * The <tt>config/index.erb</tt> template has been renamed to <tt>config/list.erb</tt>.

  * The <tt>config/search.erb</tt> template has been converted into a blog entry, as <tt>input/search.yaml</tt>.


  h1. Repairs

  * Fixed a show-stopper bug in Microsoft Windows: the *rake* command must be written with a <ins>.bat</ins> suffix, as *rake<ins>.bat</ins>*!


  h1. Additions

  * Ability to put blog entry files in the <tt>input/</tt> directory. The default output file path for these files is a mirror of its relative path in the the <tt>input/</tt> directory.

    For example, the <tt>input/foo/bar/moz.yaml</tt> source file's corresponding output file is <tt>output/foo/bar/moz.html</tt> by default.

  * Ability enable/disable generation of the table of contents either globally or per blog entry.

  * Ability to "hide" a blog entry from the lists of entries, tags, and archives.

  * Ability to use eRuby directives in more blog entry parameters. See the documentation for details.

  * Support for *&lt;format:verbatim&gt;* tags in <tt>config/format.rb</tt>. These tags protect text from being interpreted by the text-to-HTML conversion process.

  * Added a simple JavaScript search engine that was tested on IE6, Firefox 2, and Opera 9. Note that there is *no loss of functionality* for users of text-only web browsers.

  * Permalinks are now added to each heading when the table of contents generation is enabled.

  * Added a printer-friendly CSS style at <tt>input/styles/print.css</tt>.
