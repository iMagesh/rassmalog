  This release improves usability and XHTML validity, resolves some inconsistencies, and comes with a more permissive license.


  h1. Caution

  * The @String.table_of_contents@ method no longer accepts arguments.

  * The <tt>input/images/mozilla/feed-icon.png</tt> file is now located at <tt>input/images/feed-icon-28x28.png</tt>.

  * The @String.table_of_contents@ method no longer appears in the <tt>config/format.rb</tt> file because it has been incorporated into the core of Rassmalog.

  * Rassmalog is now developed under a "more permissive license":index.html#License that better reflects my ethical beliefs than "the previous license":http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html.


  h1. Repairs

  * XHTML anchors, generated for section headings and the table of contents, are now valid. They also preserve non-ASCII characters, so Unicode text is fully supported.

  * The @name@ and @menu@ parameters from <tt>config/blog.yaml</tt> are now processed by @String.to_html@ when generating HTML. As a result, you can now use Textile (or whatever formatting scheme your @String.to_html@ method supports) markup in those parameters' values.

  * The *copy* task no longer creates redundant subdirectories in <tt>output/</tt> when the destination already exists.


  h1. Usability

  * Just as a link in the table of contents takes you directly to a section, a section numbers now takes you directly to its associated link in the table of contents.

    In the past, all section numbers took you to the head of the table of contents, which was not very useful when the table of contents was long.

  * The end of an entry's text is now clearly marked by a thick black bar.
