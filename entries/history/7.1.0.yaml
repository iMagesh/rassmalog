  This release improves localization, updates the documentation, and adds better error reporting.


  h1. Features

  * Added a "locale" parameter to the main blog entry configuration file.

    This parameter allows you to translate dates, times, and currencies into any language of your choice. The translation is performed by your operating system and is NOT related to Rassmalog's translation files in any way.

    Thanks to Dieter Zinke for requesting this feature.


  h1. Repairs

  * The German translation file has been corrected by Josef 'Jupp' Schugt. Thanks!

  * The stylesheets have been reformatted for easier editing, thanks to Josef 'Jupp' Schugt.

  * The API reference documentation now documents the various parameters and attributes of blog entries (the Entry object).

    Thanks to Dieter Zinke for reminding me to do this.


  h1. Updates

  * Added better error detection and reporting when parsing the blog configuration file and general blog entry parameters.  This makes it easier to distinguish between problems in a blog entry vs. problems in Rassmalog.
