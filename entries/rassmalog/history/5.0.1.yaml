  This release fixes several defects.

  h1. Thanks

  "Josef 'Jupp' Schugt":http://www.mynetcologne.de/~nc-schugtjo/blog/ reported several defects.


  h1. Repairs

  * X11 color names have been replaced by their corresponding hex codes in the <tt>input/styles/default.css</tt> file because, as Josef 'Jupp' Schugt reports, "some browsers may ignore them altogether or, even worse, misinterpret them".

  * The content of &lt;pre&gt; &lt;tt&gt; and &lt;code&gt; tags is now properly protected and escaped as HTML by the @String.to_html@ method in <tt>config/format.rb</tt>.

  * Simplified the code that performs shell escaping.


  h1. Usability

  * An entry's information (date, tags, and comment link) is now shown in index pages by default because, as Josef 'Jupp' Schugt reports, that is what people have come to expect in a blog interface.

  * Revised the instructions presented atop the search page.
