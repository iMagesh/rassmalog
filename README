Rassmalog : static blogging with YAML and eRuby
===============================================

Rassmalog is a static blog engine written in Ruby. It produces 
valid XHTML files that you can view on your computer or upload 
to your website.

Blog entries are YAML documents that can use (1) any text-to-HTML
formatting system imaginable, including Markdown and Textile, and
(2) eRuby directives for scripting and dynamic content generation.

Please see the ./doc/guide.html file in your Web browser or visit
