  This release adds the ability to use ERB directives in the text of blog entries, adds translations for various languages, refines the automatic table of contents, and improves the obfuscation of email addresses.

  h1. Notice

  If your blog entries contain the text @<%%@ (which marks the beginning of an ERB directive), then you must escape those markers by adding an extra percentage sign (%), like this: @<%%%@. Otherwise, you will get errors from ERB when you generate your blog.

  h1. Details

  * Added translation files for various languages. These translations were made using online services such as "Babel Fish":http://world.altavista.com/ and "Systran":http://www.systransoft.com/.

  * Wrote better instructions for enabling translation files.

  * Removed numbering of links in table of contents.

  * Made the number of each heading into a link back to the table of contents. This is very useful for text-mode browsers.

  * The entire URL for sending email comments is now obfuscated.

  * Added Rassmalog version number to generated output.

  * The *text* fields of blog entries are now treated as ERB templates (see <tt>config/entry.erb</tt> for details).

  * Moved some logic from ERB templates into Rassmalog's core.
