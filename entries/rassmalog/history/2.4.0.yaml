  This release adds individual tasks for each part of the blog generation process, improves usability, and reintroduces some styling elements from previous releases.

  * Added individual tasks for each part of the blog generation process. For example, this allows you to quickly preview a blog entry as you write it -- without having to wait for the tag and archive indices to be generated every time.

  * Added a "jump to content" link, which is not visible in web browsers that support CSS, at the top of the page. This improves usability for text-based web browsers, where they can skip the navigation menu and jump directly to the content in one keystroke.

  * The default set of blog entries that come with Rassmalog have been moved into <tt>entries/rassmalog/</tt> so that (1) they do not interfere with your entries during upgrades and (2) they are readily obliterated if you want.

  * Restored the old way of presenting date, tags, and the comment URL (one per line) in entry template.
