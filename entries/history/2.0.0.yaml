  This release adds support for L10N(Localization)/I18N(Internationalization)/M17N(Multilingualization), adds new configuration parameters, fixes some bugs, and improves the documentation.

  h1. Caution

  * Generated file names no longer have spaces in them.

  * Blog entry file names are now required to end with <tt>.yaml</tt>

  * Variables available in ERB templates have been renamed.

  * The _publish_ task, which uploads your blog to your website,  has been renamed to _upload_ for clarity.

  * The _index_ parameter has been renamed to _recent_entries_ in the primary blog configuration file.

  h1. Details

  * New configuration parameters have been added to the blog configuration file:
  ** The _front_page_ parameter defines the name of a file in the output/ directory that should be the front page of your blog. This allows you to display an entry as your front page.
  ** The _summarize_entries_ parameter specifies whether entries are summarized in tag and archive pages.
  ** The _uploader_ parameter defines the command that uploads your blog to your website.

  * English text used in core of Rassmalog can now be easily translated for L10N(Localization)/I18N(Internationalization)/M17N(Multilingualization) without having to edit the source code.

  * A list of recent entries is now generated before the archives in the navigation menu.

  * Blog entry names and tags can now contain question marks and other characters in URL syntax.

  * Output is now correctly generated whenever the associated source file (configuration, blog entriess) changes.

  * Descriptions of parameters in examples and templates have been improved.

  * Incorrect detection of absolute URLs in RSS feed template has been fixed.

  * Incorrect parsing of an anchor for the table of contents has been fixed.

  * The content of &lt;code&gt; and &lt;tt&gt; elements is now preserved verbatim by the @String.to_html@ method.

  * Text that is indented in Textile (which is supposed to be pre-formatted verbatim text) is no longer processed as source code.

  * The <tt>README</tt> and <tt>HISTORY</tt> documentation files have been converted into blog entries. You're reading one of them now!
